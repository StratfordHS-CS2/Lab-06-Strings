# Lab 06 - Strings

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to get you started working with many aspects of Strings.

## Instructions
* Complete the following methods.
  * `swapWords()` - Takes a two word String as a parameter and returns the String with the words in reverse order.
  * `firstLast()` - Takes a String as a parameter and returns a String containing only the first and last characters of the String.
  * `findLetter()` - Takes a String and char as parameters and returns true or false if the char is in the String or not.
  * `findString()` - Takes two Strings as parameters and returns true or false if the second string is in the first string or not.
  * `numOfLetter()` - Takes a String and a char as parameters and returns the number of times the char is in the String.
  * `numOfString()` - Takes two Strings as parameters and returns the number of times the second string is in the first string.
  * `main()` - Edit this to add more tests of your own for each method.
* Complete a javadoc comment with the proper tags (`@param` and `@return`) for each method.

## Relevant ThinkJava Section
* [Strings](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6010.html)

## Potentially Helpful Methods
* `String.substring()`
* `String.length()`
* `String.equals()`
* `String.charAt()`
* `String.indexOf()`
* `Character.toString()`
* [All String methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)
* [All Character methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html)

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 15 - `swapWords()`
* 15 - `firstLast()`
* 10 - `findLetter()`
* 10 - `findString()`
* 15 - `numOfLetter()`
* 15 - `numOfString()`
* 10 - `main()`
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
